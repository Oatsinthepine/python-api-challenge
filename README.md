# python-api-challenge
This repo is for week 6 module api challenge.

For completing this challenge, I used the .ipynb starter_file as the main template for the assignment. So it contains some pre-written source code as instruction given. For finishing the challenge I used the geoview library website to check the documentation for plotting geo data. Also checked the openweather api and geoapify page for sample api url.
